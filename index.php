				While I was born in New Mexico, I have spent the better part of my life in California.  While I still
				lived there, I graduated from K-12 and eventually found my way into the University of California,
				Irvine.  I graduated with a double bachelors' of arts in psychology and studio arts, and my specialty is painting
				circus clowns.  Now I am back in New Mexico, and ready to move onward and upward.

				Among other things, I like fountain pens and video games. My favorite store is Santa Fe pens, which has managed
				to survive in spite of all the ups and downs in the economy.  The types of games I like run the gamut from
				slow, thoughtful puzzle games to face-paced action games.</p>
