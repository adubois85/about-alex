		<header>Three Things About Me</header>
			<h1>Quantitative</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>From 2004 to 2007, I attended the University of California, Irvine where I earned two B.A.s
					(in Psychology and Studio Arts).</li>
				<li>I started playing the violin when I was about 7 years old and played until I graduated from high
					school (but I haven't played much since starting college).</li>
				<li>My mother came back to NM to give birth to me, but we were back in CA after two weeks; from then
					until August 2012, I grew up and lived in various places around CA, mostly the high desert regions.</li>
			</ol>

			<h1>Qualitative</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>Detail-oriented</li>
				<li>Usually quiet</li>
				<li>Can be a bit slow at the start of something new, but pick-up quickly from there</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
				<p>
					Hello, my name is Alex DuBois.  I develop and maintain GIS software to enable others to more easily
					orgainze, reorganize, and analyze large sets of data, particularly with relation to geographic
