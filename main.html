				This is, sadly, me. <br><a href="/"><img src="images/alex.jpg" alt="Alex"></a><br>

			<p>
				While I was born in New Mexico, I have spent the better part of my life in California.  While I still
				lived there, I gradatuated from K-12 and eventually found my way into the University of California,
				Irvine.  In spite of myself, I managed to earn double bachelors' of arts in psychology and studio arts.
				After a number missteps and failures, I found myself stuck in New Mexico.  But that was then, and this is
				now; and now is the time to move up and move on.

				Among other things, I like fountain pens and video games.  The types of games I like run the gamut from
				slow, thoughtful puzzle games to face-paced action games.  <br>
				Currently inked: Lamy 2000 with KWZ Red #3<br>
				Currently dying to: Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin.
