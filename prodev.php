		<header>Three Things About Me</header>
			<h1>Quantitative</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>From 2004 to 2007, I attended the University of California, Irvine where I earned two B.A.s
					(in Psychology and Studio Arts).</li>
				<li>I started playing the violin when I was about 7 years old and played until I graduated from high
					school (but I haven't played much since starting college).</li>
				<li>My mother came back to NM to give birth to me, but we were back in CA after two weeks; from then
					until August 2012, I grew up and lived in various places around CA, mostly the high desert regions.</li>
			</ol>

			<h1>Qualitative</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>Detail-oriented</li>
				<li>Usually quiet</li>
				<li>Can be a bit slow at the start of something new, but pick-up quickly from there</li>
			</ol>

		<header>Golden Circles</header>
			<h1>Main Golden Circle</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Why: Create tools to reorganize and display data</li>
				<li>How: Through my own coding skills and readily available toolsets</li>
				<li>What: Develop GIS software</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
				<p>
					Hello, my name is Alex DuBois.  I develop and maintain GIS software to enable others to more easily
					orgainze, reorganize, and analyze large sets of data, particularly with relation to geographic
					information, so they may more easily discover patterns in them.  I work primarily in Javascript and
					use ESRI's mapping tools to achieve results.  Are you interested in mapping data?
				</p>

			<h1>Alternate Golden Circle</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Why: Create memorable interactive experiences.</li>
				<li>How: Through my coding skills and experience playing video games</li>
				<li>What: Developing video games</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Elevator pitch</h2>
				<p>
					Hello, my name is Alex DuBois.  I develop video games that create memorable and enjoyable experiences.
					I work primarily in C++ and the Unity engine.  Do you like to playing video games?
				</p>
		<header>Thoughts on my Capstone Team Members</header>
			<p>
				Firstly, I should say I was probably a bit more overbearing than I usually am and likely ran a bit
				roughshod over the others.  Because I don't like to go into things blind, I went ahead and looked up a rules
				primer before Friday, so I sort of took charge a bit as I had a better idea of how the game played.  With
				that said...
			</p>
			<h1>Danielle</h1>
				<p>
					She strikes me as the most "take-charge" of us all.  She always seems to be getting things done as soon
					as possible and has very solid ideas about what she wants to be doing, where she wants to be going,
					etc.  She has a vision and she works diligently towards it.
				</p>
			<h1>Dannielle (Dinn)</h1>
				<p>
					I had a much harder time reading the other two, mostly because they were more quiet, at least during the
					game.  Dinn comes across as a consensus builder.  That is to say, she is willing to be a bit more
					flexible in what she does to make sure everyone as a whole is generally happy.
				</p>
			<h1>Steve</h1>
				<p>
					As I said previously, I had a harder time reading Steve.  He is somewhat quiet, but I think that is
					partly because he is thinking through things himself.  He seems more willing to assert himself and his
					opinion than Dinn.
				</p>
